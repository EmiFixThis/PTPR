PTPR
====

 Probabilistic Targeted Port Reordering 

>	PTPR, is an algo which reorders the entire range of ports with respect to the probability of having been assigned a particular service. 

>	For the first version of the algo we have written it to reorder based on where one might be likely to find an SSL assigned. 

>	Further versions are slated for development in both a generalized direction as well as a range of specific directions, based on the assigning users behavior and capability.
